### Style Guide:

1. **Naming Conventions:** Use clear and concise names for classes, functions and variables. Avoid using abbreviations unless they are commonly understood. 

2. **Code Formatting:** Follow a consistent code formatting style. This includes consistent use of indentation, spacing and line breaks.

3. **Comments:** Make sure to write meaningful comments for complex code blocks. Comments should explain the 'why' not the 'how'.

4. **Error Handling:** Always validate input and catch exceptions. Return meaningful error messages.

5. **Code Organization:** Keep related code blocks together for better readability. Separate code into modules or files based on functionality.
